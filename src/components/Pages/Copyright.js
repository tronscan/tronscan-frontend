                <p>TRON respects copyright law and expects its users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the text of which may be found on the U.S. Copyright Office web site at <a style={{textDecoration:'underline'}} href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf</a> , TRON will respond expeditiously to notices of alleged copyright infringement that are reported to TRON’s Designated Copyright Agent, identified in the sample Notice below.<br/>
                  To file a copyright infringement notification with TRON (“Notice”), you will need to send a written communication that includes substantially the following (please consult your legal counsel or see Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA to confirm these requirements):
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
                  </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                  Not all TRON services limit their usage to registered users or other account holders. For services that do, TRON will terminate registered users or other account holders whom it determines to be repeat infringers. If you believe that a registered user or other account holder is an infringer, please follow the instructions above to contact TRON’s Designated Copyright Agent and provide information sufficient for TRON to verify that the registered user or other account holder is an infringer.
                </p>

                <h3>Subpoenas</h3>
                <p>
                  TRON may be required to disclose information to individuals asserting rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other intellectual property laws. You authorize TRON to release information about you if required by law or subpoena without notice to you.
